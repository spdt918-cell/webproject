<h2> Ethical Concerns of AI</h2>
</center>
<br>
<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
<p> The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been accompanied by significant ethical challenges. A primary concern is the bias embedded in AI algorithms, which can perpetuate existing societal prejudices. Michael Sandel, a political philosopher at Harvard, emphasizes this, noting, "Part of the appeal of algorithmic decision-making is that it seems to offer an objective way of overcoming human subjectivity, bias, and prejudice. But we are discovering that these algorithms...replicate and embed the biases that already exist in our society." Privacy issues also present major concerns, as AI technologies involve extensive data collection on individuals, potentially compromising personal information. Moreover, the use of AI could lead to high unemployment rates due to its ability to automate tasks. Joseph Fuller of Harvard Business School reflects on AI's impact on jobs, suggesting, "What we’re going to see are jobs that require human interaction, empathy, that require applying judgment to what the machine is creating [will] have robustness." Furthermore, AI's role in surveillance and military operations introduces serious ethical risks regarding accountability and misuse. Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, warns of the dangers of unchecked AI, "If we’re not thoughtful and careful, we’re going to end up with redlining again," highlighting the risk of AI systems reinforcing historical inequalities. For ethical AI implementation, it is vital to maintain transparency, uphold strict privacy protocols, and continuously work to eliminate biases, ensuring AI's benefits are distributed fairly without undermining individual rights or safety. These steps are crucial to harness AI's capabilities responsibly while addressing the ethical dilemmas it presents.</p>

<h2> How to Use AI in Your Daily Life</h2>
</center>
<br>

<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p"> 
<p> Integrating AI models such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, and DALL-E into daily routines can greatly improve your productivity and creativity. ChatGPT can be used for automating customer support and providing personalized educational programs, acting like a 24/7 digital tutor. Sam Altman emphasizes the scope of AI, predicting, "AI will handle 95 percent of tasks currently done by agencies and creatives" (Altman, 2023), which includes roles like automated tutoring and customer service. Google Gemini enhances search functions and supports content developers with its sophisticated grasp of user intentions, simplifying the information-gathering process and content production. Claude is particularly suited for sensitive environments like counseling and human resources, promoting positive and value-aligned conversations, and it is also capable of moderating online content to uphold community standards. DALL-E, on the other hand, revolutionizes creative tasks by producing distinctive images based on textual descriptions, which helps visualize ideas across graphic design, marketing, and personalized gift-making. Rick Garinier highlights the necessity of adapting to these technologies, noting, how becoming AI conversant will help in jobs across all sectors by enhancing the ability to interact with AI-powered tools and that employers will look for this skill. (Garinier, 2023). Collectively, these AI models unlock new possibilities, enhancing efficiency and customer engagement, as well as sparking innovation in various creative sectors.</p>

<h2>How to Use Visual AI</h2>
</center>
<br>

<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p"> 
<p>To utilize DALL-E, an AI capable of generating images from text descriptions, begin by crafting a detailed prompt that outlines the visual concept you want. Joe Amditis advises, "Use descriptive prompts: Be as detailed and descriptive as possible in your prompts. The more information you provide, the clearer the image DALL-E 3 can produce." This description should clearly state the main elements, style, and mood of the image, as precision aids DALL-E in accurately interpreting and creating the desired outcome. Enter this prompt into the system, and DALL-E’s neural network will process it to produce images that align with your specifications. If the initial results aren’t perfect, you can refine them by tweaking the prompt or trying different variations to see other creative possibilities. As Amditis suggests, "Take an iterative approach: Don’t hesitate to refine your prompts based on previous outputs. Iterative adjustments can lead to the perfect image." DALL-E is particularly valuable for tasks such as graphic design, content creation, and making personalized gifts, offering a unique way to transform abstract ideas into tangible visual representations. This flexibility and adaptability make it an indispensable tool in the arsenal of modern digital creatives.</p>

<img src="images/Volcano 1.jpeg" style="width:500px; height:auto; border: 3px solid gray;">
    <div class="margin-modifier">
<div class="box-p">
<p>To create this image I gave Dall-E the prompt: Paint a dramatic scene of a volcanic eruption near a body of water, showing a stark contrast between fire and water. Use bold, contrasting colors to capture the dramatic interplay of elements. This was DALL-E’s response</p>
</div>

<img src="images/Volcano 2.jpeg" style="width:500px; height:auto; border: 3px solid gray;">
<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
<p>I wanted to make the image look more like a painting so I asked it to "make it look more like a painting" and this was its response.</p>
</div>
</div>
<img src="images/Portrait 1.jpg" style="width:500px; height:auto; border: 3px solid gray;">
<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
<p>For this next image I gave Dall-E the prompt: Generate an image of a young man in his early 20s, Hispanic with short black hair, wearing a casual  t-shirt. The cat is a large adult tabby with brown eyes. The man is sitting in an armchair with the cat on his lap, they are both happy, the background is a brightly lit modern living room with lots of natural light. This was DALL-E’s response.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<img src="images/Portait 2.jpg" style="width:500px; height:auto; border: 3px solid gray;">
<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
<p>I wanted to change the background of the portrait so I asked Dall-E to "make the background the inside of a space station overlooking the earth" and this is what it generated.</p>

<img src="images/Neon City 1.jpeg" style="width:500px; height:auto; border: 3px solid gray;">
<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
<p>For this image I wanted to create an image that looked more realistic and I gave Dall-E the prompt: Generate a photograph of a neon-lit city with bustling nightlife and two cars racing in the forefront. This was what it generated.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<img src="images/Neon City 2.jpeg" style="width:500px; height:auto; border: 3px solid gray;">
<div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
<p>The first image wasn't as realistic as I hoped so I asked "make it look like a realistic photograph". As you can see this second image looks more realistic than the first.</p>
