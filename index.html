    <h2>Definition and Overview of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
</center>
    <div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can mimic human intelligence. This technology enables machines to perform complex tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI operates through the use of algorithms and statistical models that analyze large data sets to identify patterns and make predictions. Notably, AI applications range from simple tasks like spam filtering to advanced functions such as powering virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa and even driving autonomous vehicles. As McCallum, Vallance, and Clarke (2023) highlight, "AI systems are trained on huge amounts of information and learn to identify the patterns in it, in order carry out tasks such as having a human-like conversation or predicting a product an online shopper might buy" (McCallum et al., 2023).</p>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, each with unique architectures and functions, are shaping the future of conversational technologies. <strong>ChatGPT </strong>by OpenAI noted for its transformer architecture, learns from vast data to create human-like text, as highlighted by McCallum, Vallance, and Clarke (2023). Google's <strong>Gemini</strong> aims to surpass these models in efficiency, offering deeper language understanding with lower computational demands. Similarly, Anthropic's <strong>Claude</strong>, though simpler, shares foundational technology with ChatGPT and excels in generating safe, human-aligned outputs. Dr. Brian Collins (2023) emphasizes the role of extensive data and advanced algorithms in refining these AI models for greater accuracy and reliability, underscoring the evolving landscape toward more nuanced AI interactions.</p>

    <h2> Visual AI</h2>
</center>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <ul>
        <li>DALL-E</li>
        <li>Midjourney</li>
        <li>Sora</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="margin-modifier">
    <div class="box-p">
    <p> Visual AI interprets and processes visual data similarly to human vision, involving image and video analysis and recognition. DALL-E 3, by OpenAI, generates detailed images from text descriptions. Joe Amditis praises its utility for creators, noting it provides "a fitting visual accompaniment to elevate their written content or event page." This model features a modified transformer architecture, enhancing its prompt interpretation, which Amditis describes as being able to "interpret prompts in novel ways." Similarly, MidJourney creates high-quality visuals from text, blending abstract and realistic elements, and encourages detailed prompts for clearer images. Another tool, Sora, focuses on real-time video analysis, useful for surveillance to content creation. Rick Garinier highlights the efficiency of these tools: "Visual AI like DALL-E 3 and MidJourney automate the creative process, allowing for rapid generation of assets and optimizing mundane tasks," which helps "free creative minds to focus on strategy and innovation," showcasing Visual AI's transformative impact on visual content creation.</p>
